# TaxCalculator

The program computes the income tax for an individual whose filing status is "Single". The program asks the user to enter the total taxable income for the year. The program then uses the tax brackets (as shown below) to calculate the tax amount:
    10% on taxable income from $0 to $9,525, plus
    12% on taxable income over $9,526 to $38,700, plus
    22% on taxable income over $38,701 to $82,500, plus
    24% on taxable income over $82,501 to $157,500, plus
    32% on taxable income over $157,501 to $200,000, plus
    35% on taxable income over $200,001 to $500,000, plus
    37% on taxable income over $500,001 or more
The program displays the total tax due to the user.
